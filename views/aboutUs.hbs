                I'm Yorick and I hope you enjoy our music streaming app. 
                We thought it would be nice to combine the cool design from spotify 
                with the easy ability to add new songs to the database of songs. 
                Since music is quite an important source of entertainment in every day life, 
                I thought what better app to create than try and improve current music technologies.

                As stated above, my name is Vathusan but you can call me Vathu.
                I'm a computer science student at John Abbott College.
                Like all my fellow developers, I'm a immense music enthusiast.
                I mostly listen to drill and afro music, but I don't mind any genre.
                My colleagues and I developed this platform, so all the music lovers can
                have a space to add, discover and enjoy any type of music. If you have 
                any ideas that can help improve your experience with this platform,

                Hi! My name is Resham and I am an avid music listener. I listen to a wide variety
                of songs but I'm a sucker for strong pop vocals. I'm currently enrolled in John Abbott College
                in Computer Science. While I love music, I also love technology and web design so I decided
                to create this project with my friends to make music accessible to everyone as it is
                an art that must be enjoyed for everyone. My socials are listed below, welcome to RYV Records!
